= chip8stuff
:experimental:

Simple interpreter to execute https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8[CHIP-8] games.
Capable of creating standalone executables with embedded ROM files, even after compile time.

Passes the https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite[Timendus/chip8-test-suite] tests (except for the _display wait_ quirk).
The sound timer and playback is not implemented yet, since I have not yet tested any rom that makes use of it.


Rendering is done using the https://github.com/parasyte/pixels[Pixels] crate.
All features are tested only on Linux and X11.

== Usage


Pass the rom file via command line argument
[source, shell]
----
./chip8stuff <ROM_FILE>
----

Use `--paused` to start the debugger in paused mode, allowing you to single-step right from the start.

[source, shell]
----
./chip8stuff <ROM_FILE> --paused
----

=== Creating standlone executables with embedded ROM file

You can use the `--embed` command to create a copy of the executable that will include the given ROM file, so it can be executed directly without depending on a separate ROM file. The ROM will be appended to the ELF executable, followed by a trailer consisting of the magic value `0xC8` and the length of the ROM as `16` (_big endian_).

The new executable will be placed in the current working directory with the name `chip8stuff_<ROM_FILE>_player`

[source, shell]
----
./chip8stuff --embed <ROM_FILE>
# run the new executable
./chip8stuff_<ROM_FILE>_player
----

See `--verbose` for detailed logging and `--help` for usage help.

== Input

The original hex keypad
[width=25%]
|==============
| kbd:[1] | kbd:[2] | kbd:[3] | kbd:[C]
| kbd:[4] | kbd:[5] | kbd:[6] | kbd:[D]
| kbd:[7] | kbd:[8] | kbd:[9] | kbd:[E]
| kbd:[a] | kbd:[0] | kbd:[B] | kbd:[F]
|==============

is mapped to the keyboard as following:
[width=25%]
|==============
| kbd:[1] | kbd:[2] | kbd:[3] | kbd:[4]
| kbd:[Q] | kbd:[W] | kbd:[E] | kbd:[R]
| kbd:[A] | kbd:[S] | kbd:[D] | kbd:[F]
| kbd:[Y] | kbd:[X] | kbd:[C] | kbd:[V]
|==============


== Debug features

- view register values
- view executed instructions
- pause execution/single step
- dump memory to a file, the exact file name will be printed on `stdout` at `info` level
