= chip8stuff
:experimental:

Simple interpreter to execute https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8[CHIP-8] games.

Passes the https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite[Timendus/chip8-test-suite] tests (except for the _display wait_ quirk).
The sound timer and playback is not implemented yet, since I have not yet tested any rom that makes use of it.

== Usage


Pass the rom file via command line argument
[source, shell]
----
./chip8stuff <ROM_FILE>
----

Use `--paused` to start the debugger in paused mode, allowing you to single-step right from the start.

[source, shell]
----
./chip8stuff <ROM_FILE> --paused
----

== Input

The original hex keypad
[width=25%]
|==============
| 1 | 2 | 3 | C

| 7 | 8 | 9 | E

is mapped to the keyboard as following:

| kbd:[Y] | kbd:[X] | kbd:[C] | kbd:[V]
|==============
