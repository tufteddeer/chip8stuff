= chip8stuff
:experimental:

Simple interpreter to execute https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8[CHIP-8] games.

Passes the https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite[Timendus/chip8-test-suite] tests (except for the _display wait_ quirk).
The sound timer and playback is not implemented yet, since I have not yet tested any rom that makes use of it.


Rendering is done using the https://github.com/parasyte/pixels[Pixels] crate.
Tested only on Linux and X11.

== Usage


Pass the rom file via command line argument
[source, shell]
----
./chip8stuff <ROM_FILE>
----

Use `--paused` to start the debugger in paused mode, allowing you to single-step right from the start.

[source, shell]
----
./chip8stuff <ROM_FILE> --paused
----

Use `--verbose` for detailed logging and `--help` for usage help.
